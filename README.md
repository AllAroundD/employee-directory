# employee-directory
employee directory is an app that lets users view, create, and track daily workouts. Users should be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track the distance traveled.
