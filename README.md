# employee-directory
  Employee Directory is an app that lets users view a small table of employees, sort the table by 8 categories, and allows to filter the users by first name. This is a simple application to show some features of React. This is a small application so the list of employees is in the utils/employees.json file and can be easily maintained.

## Installation
  For just using the application, there is no installation required. The application url is http://employee-directory-dm.herokuapp.com/.
  For the local setup of this application, there are a few npm modules that are required (react, react-scripts, react-dom, etc.). Once the repository is cloned, typing 'npm install' at the command prompt will install all of the required modules.
  Once the user clones and runs the program, the application will open in a browser window.
  Here is an example of the command to run in development mode:
  git clone https://github.com/AllAroundD/employee-directory.git && cd employee-directory && npm install && npm run startdev. A browser tab or window opens to 'http://localhost:3000/'
  To run local production mode, type 'npm start', then open a browser tab and go to 'http://localhost:5000'.

## Usage
  For just using the application, the application url http://employee-directory-dm.herokuapp.com/ is where the application resides.
  If installing locally, see the installation steps above to install and then run the application to open a browser window/tab.
